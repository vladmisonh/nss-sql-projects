# SQL Job Market Analysis â€“ Data Analyst Positions

This project analyzes job postings for **Data Analysts, Data Scientists, and Data Engineers** based on data from [Kaggleâ€™s Indeed Job Postings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/elroyggj/indeed-dataset-data-scientistanalystengineer). The analysis was performed using **PostgreSQL** in **pgAdmin 4** as part of the **Nashville Software School (NSS)** Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The goal of this project was to develop strong querying skills using **structured SQL** techniques while gaining insights into the U.S. data job market, especially for analyst-related roles.

## Project Overview

The dataset contains job postings with information such as job title, company name, location, industry (domain), required skills, review count, star rating, and days since the job was posted.

Through this analysis, I answered questions such as:

* Which U.S. states have the highest number of analyst jobs?
* What companies have the highest average ratings?
* How many jobs specifically mention SQL skills?
* What industries struggle to fill SQL-related jobs?

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **PostgreSQL** (SQL dialect used)
* **pgAdmin 4** (SQL IDE)
* Aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `ROUND`)
* Filtering (`WHERE`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`)
* Sorting (`ORDER BY`)
* Grouping (`GROUP BY`)
* String pattern matching (`ILIKE`, `LOWER`)
* Subsetting with `LIMIT`

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes

This project helped reinforce:

* Real-world SQL querying in PostgreSQL
* Data exploration and insight extraction from job market data
* Filtering text-based fields using pattern matching
* Using aggregates to summarize large datasets
