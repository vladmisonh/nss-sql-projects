# SQL Data Analytics Projects - NSS Bootcamp  

Welcome to my repository, where I have stored the SQL projects I completed during my time at Nashville Software School (NSS) as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with **PostgreSQL** in **pgAdmin 4**, utilizing SQL for querying, transforming, and analyzing data.  

## Overview  

The projects in this repository highlight the key milestones of my learning journey in SQL. Through hands-on experience, I have developed skills in querying relational databases, optimizing data retrieval, performing aggregations, and gaining insights from structured datasets.  

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here  

### Key Projects:  
- **Data Extraction and Querying**: Writing SQL queries to extract meaningful information from large datasets using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP BY`.  
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Using SQL to clean and prepare raw data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
- **Database Joins and Relationships**: Implementing `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` to combine data from multiple tables efficiently.  
- **Aggregations and Window Functions**: Utilizing functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `RANK()` to analyze and summarize data.  
- **Subqueries and CTEs**: Writing complex queries using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and subqueries for better readability and efficiency.  
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, and understanding execution plans to improve SQL performance.  

### Skills Demonstrated:  
- Writing efficient **PostgreSQL** queries in **pgAdmin 4**.  
- Designing relational data models and working with **primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints**.  
- Using **aggregate functions, window functions, and subqueries** for deeper data analysis.  
- Performing **ETL operations** (Extract, Transform, Load) within a SQL environment.  
- Creating and managing database views for reporting and analysis.
